**Phd student and postdoc positions in neuroscience**

Applications are invited for one PhD student and one postdoctoral researcher in neuroscience, at the University of Bern, Switzerland. The research focus will be on studying the neural and computational mechanisms underlying the generation of sensory predictions. To this aim, the employed student and postdoc will design computational models of learning and will combine those with electrophysiological recordings in humans to investigate predictive processes in the auditory modality, in wakefulness and sleep.

Our [group](https://www.inf.unibe.ch/about_us/team/cognitive_computational_neuroscience_ccn/index_eng.html) is using scalp and intracranial electroencephalography -EEG- recordings, machine learning and computational modeling techniques, as well as single-unit measurements in humans. The positions will be based at the Institute for Computer Science and Faculty of Medicine at the University of Bern in Switzerland, under the supervision of Athina Tzovara.

#### What we offer:

* Funded positions for three years, according to Swiss National Science Foundation regulations
* Access to scalp and intracranial EEG recordings
* Funding for conferences or summer schools
* Interdisciplinary and international research environment at the University of Bern

#### Your profile:

*	You are interested in using computational tools to study functions of the human brain
*	You have experience or would like to acquire experience in analyzing time-series data e.g. EEG
*	You are fluent in English

#### Requirements for the PhD position:

* Master in biomedical engineering, computer science, neuroscience, physics or a related discipline
* Experience with analysing physiological data and in particular EEG data
* Experience with machine learning or other modeling techniques
* Programming skills in Python, R or Matlab

#### Requirements for the Postdoc position:

* PhD in neuroscience, biomedical engineering, computer science, or a related discipline
* Experience with computational modeling and/or experience analyzing scalp or intracranial EEG data
* Programming experience in Python or R

#### How to apply:

Applications will be accepted until the positions are filled. The first review of applications will begin on 20th January 2020. If you are interested, please send one pdf-document including your CV, a brief statement of research interests, and the contact details of two referees to:
Athina Tzovara, athina.tzovara@inf.unibe.ch 

Informal inquiries are welcome.
